# PSCreateADForest

PSCreateADForest is a PowerShell module designed to quickly create new Active Directory forests and domain controllers. It's ideal for disaster recovery, setting up AD from scratch, or creating test and development environments efficiently, allowing for rapid deployment and teardown without starting from scratch.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

## Usage

### Examples

#### Creating a New Active Directory Forest

This example shows how to set up a NEW Active Directory Forest and a new Domain Controller. Before starting this process, the new Domain Controller must not be actively joined to an existing Active Directory domain.

```powershell
Invoke-DomainControllerNetworkSettings -Hostname "DC1" -IPv4Address "192.168.1.10" -IPv4Prefix 24 -IPv4Gateway "192.168.1.1" -IPv4DNS "8.8.8.8"
Restart-Computer -Force
```
In the first step, we are setting the new hostname of this server instance. However, if the server is already set to the desired hostname, supply the current hostname of the device. The IPv4Address MUST be an IP address that is currently NOT in use.  This will be the NEW IP address of the server going forward.

After the first reboot, creating the new Domain Controller and setting up the forest is now possible.

```powershell
Install-NewAdForestAndPromote -DomainName "example.com" -NetBiosName "EXAMPLE" -Mode "Win2012"
Restart-Computer -Force
```

Reboot after this action has completed and the Domain Controller will now be configured and ready to use.
