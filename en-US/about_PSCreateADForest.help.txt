SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Rapidly create new Active Directory Forests and Domain Controllers.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSCreateADForest is a PowerShell module designed to quickly create new
    Active Directory forests and domain controllers. It's ideal for disaster
    recovery, setting up AD from scratch, or creating test and development
    environments efficiently, allowing for rapid deployment and teardown without
    starting from scratch.

EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE 1
    This example shows how to set up a NEW Active Directory Forest and a new
    Domain Controller. Before starting this process, the new Domain Controller
    must not be actively joined to an existing Active Directory domain.

    Invoke-DomainControllerNetworkSettings -Hostname "DC1" -IPv4Address "192.168.1.10" -IPv4Prefix 24 -IPv4Gateway "192.168.1.1" -IPv4DNS "8.8.8.8"
    Restart-Computer -Force

    In the first step, we are setting the new hostname of this server instance. 
    However, if the server is already set to the desired hostname, supply the
    current hostname of the device. The IPv4Address MUST be an IP address that
    is currently NOT in use.  This will be the NEW IP address of the server
    going  forward.
    After the first reboot, creating the new Domain Controller and setting up
    the forest is now possible.

    Install-NewAdForestAndPromote -DomainName "example.com" -NetBiosName "EXAMPLE" -Mode "Win2012"
    Restart-Computer -Force

    Reboot after this action has completed and the Domain Controller will now be
     configured and ready to use.

EXAMPLE 2
    This example demonstrates how to add additional domain controllers to the
    newly created Active Directory forest that was created in Example 1. Before
    starting, the new server must be added to the domain.  Firstly, the DNS
    server used by this device must be set to the IP address used for the first
    domain controller.

    Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex (Get-NetAdapter).ifIndex -ServerAddresses ("192.168.1.10")

    Now that the DNS server has been set on this machine, the machine can now be
    added to the domain. Unfortunately, this is Windows and a reboot is required
    after this action.

    Add-Computer -DomainName example.com -Credential example.com\Administrator
    Restart-Computer -Force

    After the reboot has taken place, we will apply network settings for the
    domain controller.

    Invoke-DomainControllerNetworkSettings -Hostname "DC2" -IPv4Address "192.168.1.11" -IPv4Prefix 24 -IPv4Gateway "192.168.1.1" -IPv4DNS "192.168.1.10"
    Restart-Computer -Force

    Once this reboot is complete, add the new domain controller and reboot

    Add-NewDomainController
    Restart-Computer -Force
